    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a three-part interactive dashboard structure. A filterable navigation list on the left allows users to easily find and select principles. The central panel provides a focused, detailed view of the selected principle's text and scriptural source. The right panel offers context through a dynamic thematic chart and a list of related principles. This structure was chosen to transform the dense textual report into an exploratory experience. It breaks down information into digestible chunks, prevents cognitive overload, and encourages non-linear discovery by revealing thematic connections between concepts, thus enhancing user understanding and engagement far more effectively than a linear page. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Report Info: Hierarchical categories of principles. Goal: Organize. Method: Interactive Filter Buttons. Interaction: Click to filter the main list. Justification: Provides immediate high-level sorting for the user. Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Report Info: Detailed description of each principle. Goal: Inform. Method: Formatted Text Block. Interaction: Dynamically updated on selection. Justification: Clear, focused presentation of core content. Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Report Info: Implicit themes within each principle (e.g., social vs. personal focus). Goal: Compare & Analyze. Method: Polar Area Chart. Interaction: Dynamically updates to show the thematic DNA of the selected principle. Justification: Offers a quick, visual "at-a-glance" analysis that is difficult to glean from text alone. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Shared concepts between principles. Goal: Relationships. Method: Dynamically generated list of "Related Principles." Interaction: Clickable links to navigate to related items. Justification: Encourages deeper exploration and helps users build a mental map of the interconnected concepts. Library: Vanilla JS. -->
